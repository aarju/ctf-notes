        .Description
        Queries WMI event subscriber classes commonly used by malware for persistence. Queries the root\Subscription namespace looking for __FilterToConsumerBinding entries then finds the associated consumer and filter for the binding. Returns the subscription event as a single object
        
        .PARAMETER Computer
        IP address or hostname of the machine to query. Default will run the query against the local system. Can be passed in via the pipeline.
