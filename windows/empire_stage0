# little technique for hosting your launcher scripts on a different host than your empire server
# also good when you have a limited size constraint, such as in shellcode or manual typing.

# create a multi/launcher without base64 encoding
# save the launcher output to a file and host that on a webserver. Maybe even Github
# get a shortened URL to the host, or memorize the IP.
# Execute stage0 on a host, could be shellcode, or just execution
